1. White-spaces can be freely used to start the line of code. Here are few valid
lines of MIXAL code:
    ``` {.asm .numberLines}
    |    * comment for with white-spaces at the beginning
    |  LABEL SUB
    |     LDA 1000
    ```
2. Because of allowing spaces inside any expression, in-line comments should start
with any lower-case character, like in the example below:
    ``` asm 
    ADD 1 comment
    ```
