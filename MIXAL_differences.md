1. White-spaces can be freely used to start the line of code
2. Any amount of white-spaces can be used to separate LABEL/OPERATION/ADDRESS fields


Here are few valid lines of MIXAL code:
``` {.asm .numberLines}
|    * comment for with white-spaces at the beginning
|  LABEL     SUB
|     LDA 1000
|    IN OUT    16         note: "IN" is a LABEL
```
